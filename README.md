# **GGE**
### Guss' s Game Engine

*The purpose of this project is to create a complete, powerful, flexible, but easy-to-use C++ game engine.*
> For early versions (the project is currently in POC developpement steps), SFML library (*https://github.com/SFML/SFML*) is used (for rendering only).
> For all (including final version), this project use GCL_CPP library (*https://github.com/GuillaumeDua/GCL_CPP*).

```
This library aims to be as **flexible** as possible, both statically and dynamically, using hybrid design half-way between Policies (A.Alexandrescu) and Behaviors.

This library also aims to be **fast**. Thus, it uses lots of template-metaprogramming mecanisms.

This library also aims to be **easy-to-use**. Thus, many components are black-boxed design.
